The "Let's Make Games" YouTube channel helped with understanding how SDL2 and C++ work together to create an interactive display window. These tutorials helped with setting up the foundation for the rest of our project up until Checkpoint 1.

For generating a random maze, we found a blog online that discussed a few different algorithms that could be used for that task. From this blog we decided to go with the Recursive Backtracing method of generating a random maze each time the game is run.

This repo helped us figure out which packages are needed for CI builds of the project.
