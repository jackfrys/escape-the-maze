# Instructions

Launch the game from the terminal with `$ ./main`. Follow the prompt to choose a difficulty level.

Once in the maze, use the arrow keys to move the player, `blue`. Collect all the key fragments, `yellow`, to create the key, while avoiding the guards, `green`.

Once all key fragments have been collected, exit the maze and win by navigating to the lower right corner. Any contact with a guard will immediately lose the game.
