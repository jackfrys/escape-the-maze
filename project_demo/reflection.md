# Demo Reflection

## Well Recieved
The maze game worked very well during the demo. A few students sat down and completed the easy level by collecting all the keys and reaching the end. A few others tried the harder levels (larger size) but that takes too long to finish during a demo. Everyone seemed pretty happy that the mazes are randomly generated each time, so no two games will be alike.

## Improvements
The menu of the game is probably a bit too abstract. The three sets of blocks to represent easy, medium, and hard are not clear enough. A good improvement would be to rework this screen to make it a bit easier to understand, while not detracting from the abstract theme our entire game's visual design adheres to.

Another worthwhile improvement would be enhancing the logic the guards use when moving around. The current, random strategy causes them to perpetually block certain paths.

## Surprises
Some plays found that if they sneak by a guard quickly, it doesn't remove a life. This quirk is a relic from before we implemented lives, to avoid having the game be impossible to solve if a guard happens to be in the way. We were surprised someone noticed this given the life system and lack of sudden death.
