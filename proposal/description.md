# Description

We will create a maze game where the user has to go navigate a randomly-generated environment, collecting key fragments as they go. When all key fragments are collected, the resulting key can be used to open the door at the end of the maze.

Working against the user, there are guards patrolling the maze. Get too close to a guard and the game is over.

Difficulty is increased by adding guards, key fragments, and size to the maze.
